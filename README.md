Python 3 program that draws one circle and one line and computes the amount of intersections 


The program will present an 800x600 pixel window with (0,0) being the bottom left corner point and
(800,600) being the top right corner point. Within this coordinate system, the program will draw an x
and y axes that identify the centre of the window. 

The program will prompt the user for values that define a circle and a line in this coordinate system inside the console and draw them. 
Finally, the program will perform calculations to determine whether the line and circle intersect, and how many times.
